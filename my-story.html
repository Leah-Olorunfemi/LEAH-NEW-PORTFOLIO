                        I've always been fascinated by websites ðŸ˜Ž. I always wondered about what went on, under the hood
                        that made them so engaging
                        , so appealing and so interactive.
                        My fascination grew when I was awarded a scholarship by Ingressive For Good to learn web site
                        development @
                        StartWebAfrica. For the first time, I had a glimpse of what went into website development.
                        I came to learn of such terms like padding, margin, borders, border-radiuses and waht have you.
                        I thorougly enjoyed the course. But
                        then I thought why not do it from scratch! Asides using a web-builder. It was possible, wasn't
                        it.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        With my newly-developed
                        sense of tech, I went
                        hunting on where else, the Internet of course ðŸ˜† and then I came across Shecodes amongst others.
                        Shecodes is an
                        online coding workshop for
                        women. I could not afford the fees but with further snooping, I realized they could offer me a
                        scholarship since I was
                        from a disadvantaged country, financially speaking. So I applied. Kept checking my mail and
                        rechecking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nothing ðŸ¥², until one evening, when I checked again. Anxiously opened it to know if I was going
                        to
                        smile or not, and
                        then I did smile, like my smiley emoji does. I was asked to choose a start date. I scanned my
                        itinerary mentally, picked
                        a date and statrted.
                        Fast forward... I can now desiign my own websites from scratch, customize the padding, margins
                        of
                        various elements and
                        use various frameowrks to achieve wha I want.

                    <p>
                        I wouldn't have been able to arrive at this point,
                        without I4G,
                        StartWebAfrica and of course Shecodes!
                        I will always remain grateful to Matt Delac for being such an effortless and untiring
                        instructor.
                        Some folks have the
                        knowledge but not the ability to pass that knowledge across to someone else. Matt possess both.
                        Brilliant depth of
                        programming knowledge and an amazing ability to breakdown technicalities make him an uncommon
                        breed.
                        Its' been a real
                        privilege to have been tutored by him.
